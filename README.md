In order to run this page on your machine you'll need XAMPP with Apache and MySql (I've been using version 3.3.0). The code will automatically create the database for you, 
however you need to set 'seed_the_database' param from db_connect.php to 'true' in order to create and seed the tables necessary for the page to run.
